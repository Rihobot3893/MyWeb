<h1>Simple Machine </h1>

<h2>1.Purposes of machines</h2>
<em>what are <strong >simple machines</strong> ?</em><br>
<p>A<strong > machine</strong > is a device that is specially designed or engineered to help make it easier to do <strong>mechanical work</strong >(Which is given by<strong >W=Fs</strong>).<br><strong >Machine</strong > makes a work easier by performing one or more of the following :<br>
<ul><li>increasing <strong >magnitude</strong > of <strong >applied force</strong >
     <li>changing <strong >the direction</strong > of the applied force or transferring an applied force from one place to another 
      <li>increasing <strong >the distance moved</strong > against the applied force(or the speed of the force moves).</ul><br>
<em style="color :red;"><strong >Note:</strong > Machine can <strong >not create an extra energy (i.e doesn't break the law of conservation of energy ).</strong ></em>
<br>In other words,the work you put in cannot be greater than the work you get out.But from above lists of what a machines do, it is possible to get more force out than you put in.<strong >THINK ABOUT IT CAREFULLY !!</strong ></p> 
<p>When you apply a force to a machine this applied force is called <strong > Effort </strong >.In order to do mechanical work,this effort <strong >need to move</strong > through a distance .<br>
Now the above equation <strong >W=Fs</strong > could be rewrite as:<br>
<strong ><ul><li>Work input = effort × distance moved by effort .</ul></strong ><br>
The machine then provides a work out put;this may be used to move a force (referred to as <strong >load</strong >)through a distance.In equation terms:<br>
<strong >Work output = load × distance moved by load.</strong ><br>
<em>Note: A<strong > load</strong > is that object that we try to move or lift or simply an object on which output force acts while an <strong >effort</strong > is the input force that we apply to move or lift the load.</em>
<br><em>If there were no energy losses inside our machine then:</em><br>
        <ul> <li><strong >Work input = Work output </strong >
        <li><strong >Effort × distance moved by effort =Load × distance moved by load</strong ></ul><br>
So,if the machine has been designed so the distance moved by the load is less than the distance moved by the effort then the load can be greater than the effort. This means a <strong >small effort</strong > can be used to move a <strong >large load</strong >.</p>
<p>The term,<strong >simple machine</strong >, refers to a machine that is well simple.This has lots of interpretations including:<br>
<ul><li>A device that only requires a single force to work 
        <li>A device for doing work that has only one part
        <li>A device that uses a single effort to do work against the single load force 
</ul><br>
<em><strong >Simple machines</strong > are often described as the elementary building blocks from which all other Machines are made.</em></p>
<em><strong >Types of simple machine </strong ></em>
<p>There are six different types of simple machine;
<ul><li>inclined plane<li>wedge <li>screw<li>lever<li>Wheel and axel</ul>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/simple-machine"> animated video </a>
Simple machines can be split into two groups Wedges and screws can be thought of as a special kinds of inclined planes.Pulleys and wheels and access can be considered to be special kinds of levers.<br>
No matter which type of simple machine we deal with they will fit into one or more of the following categories.
<ol><li>Force multiplier <li>Speed multiplier <li>Direction changer</ol>
</p><p><strong >I.Force multiplier</strong ><br>
These are machines designed so that the load is greater than the effort.
<br>This is only possible if the load moves through a smaller distance than the effort.

<br>
<strong >II.Speed multiplier</strong ><br>
These are machines designed so that the distance moved by the load is greater than the distance moved by the effort in the same time.<br>
This is only possible if the load is a smaller force than the effort.
<img src="" alt="A schematic of a speed multiplier">
<br>
<strong >III.Direction changers</strong ><br>
These are machines designed so that the load is moved in a different direction to the effort .
</p>
<p>Depending on how they are designed some machines can act as both force or speed multipliers and Direction changers.However,a machine <strong >cannot multiply both the force and the speed</strong > of the same time which would mean the work output would be greater than the work input.</p>
<p>
<h3 class="edit">what are the terms that are used to compare different Machines </h3>
Some machines are more effective than others. <br>
For instance,One type of force multiplier might be able to move a 100 N load when 20 N of effort 
is applied. Another might be able to move a 500 N with the same 
effort.<br>
It is not just a simple case of the greater the load that can be 
moved the better the machine, there are a number of other factors. 
However, there are two terms that are often used to compare 
different machines. These are <strong >mechanical advantage (MA) </strong >and 
<strong >velocity ratio (VR)</strong >.<br>
<ol class="edit"><li><strong>Mechanical advantage (AMA and IMA)</strong ></ol>
<ul><li>It refers to the ratio between the load and the effort.</ul>
For example, if a machine moves a 400 N load when 
an effort of 100 N is applied the mechanical advantage is four. In 
other words you get 4× the force out of the machine. Mechanical 
advantage can be calculated using the following equation:<br>
<strong class="center">Mechanical advantage = load / effort<br>
MA = load / effort</strong ><br>
<em>MA has no units since it is a ratio.</em><br>
Generally,<ul class="edit"><li>If the MA is 1 this means that the 
effort equals the load. <li>If the MA is two the load is twice the effort 
and <li>if the MA is 0.5 the load is half the size of the effort.</ul>
<em>Mechanical advantage is most frequently used to compare force 
multipliers. If the MA is greater than one the machine can be considered a force multiplier (as the load is greater than the effort).</em><br>
<strong >There are actually two kinds of mechanical advantage;</strong ><ol><li><strong >Actual mechanical advantage (AMA)</strong ></li>This compares the force you get out (load) compared with what you 
put in (effort).<li><strong >Ideal mechanical advantage (IMA).</strong ></li>This 
is the mechanical advantage if there were no other energy losses 
(e.g. no losses through friction, etc.).</ol>
<em>For most of our calculations 
and examples we will assume that there are no energy losses. In this 
case <strong class="edit">IMA = AMA </strong >and so there is no need to distinguish between 
the two. However, in the real world IMA is always greater than AMA.</em><br>
<ol class="edit"><li value=2><strong>Velocity ratio (VR)</strong ></ol>
<ul><li>refers to the ratio between the distance moved by the effort and the distance moved by the load.</ul>
For example, if an effort has to move 30 m in order to move a load 3 m 
then the velocity ratio is 3.<br>
<strong class="center">Velocity ratio = distance moved by effort / distance moved by 
load.<br>
VR = distance moved by effort / distance moved by load.</strong ><br>
<em>Just like MA, VR has no units since it is a ratio.</em><br>
Overall,<ul class ="edit"> <li>If the VR is 1 this means that the effort and the load both move the same distance. <li>If 
the VR is 2 then the effort has to move twice as far as the load and <li>if 
the VR is 0.5 then the load ends up moving twice as far as the effort.<li>If the VR is less than 1 the machine can be considered a speed 
multiplier (as the distance moved by the load is greater than the distance moved by the effort).</ul>
<h4>Efficiency of machines</h4>
<em>Note that <strong >no machine</strong > can increase both the magnitude 
and the distance of a force at the same time which would break 
the law of conservation of energy.<br>
When a machine provides an <strong >increase in force</strong > there must always be a <strong >decrease in the distance</strong > 
the force is moved. The reverse is also true; if a machine provides 
an<strong > increase in the distance </strong >the force moves then there will be 
a<strong > decrease in force </strong >(another way to think about this is that no 
machine can produce more work than the amount of work that is put into the machine).</em><br>
<ul><li><strong >Efficiency </strong >(given the symbol η)</li>is the ratio between the 
<strong >work output </strong >and the <strong >work input</strong >. <br>It is often then multiplied by 100 
to give a percentage. The equation is as follows:</ul>
<strong class="center" >Efficiency = work output / work input<br
>η = work output / work input</strong ><br>
<em>Just like MA and VR, efficiency has no units since it is a ratio.</em><br>
We can also express efficiency in terms of MA and VR by expanding 
our equations for work output and work input:<br>
<strong >Efficiency = work output / work input</strong ><br>
<strong class="center">Efficiency = (load × distance moved by load) / (effort ×
distance moved by effort)<br>
load / effort = AMA</strong ><br>
distance moved by load / distance moved by effort = 1 / VR <br>
So<br>
<strong >efficiency = AMA / VR <br>
η = AMA/VR</strong ><br>
<em>So a machine with an MA of 6 and a VR of 8 has an efficiency of:</em><br>
η = AMA/VR = 6 / 8 <br>
η = 0.75 (or 75%)<br>
If AMA = VR then the machine would be 100 % efficient.<br>
<p>If the machine was 100% efficient then:<br>
              η = AMA/VR = 1 <br>
              AMA = VR <br>
<em>In this case as there are no energy losses then the AMA would be 
equal to the IMA and so to calculate IMA we could use:<br></em>
            AMA = IMA = VR<br>
            IMA = distance moved by effort / distance moved by load<br></p>
The VR is also equal to the maximum theoretical MA (IMA).

<p><h5 class="edit">Examples and Exercises </h5>
<em>worked example </em><br>
1.A simple machine provides a work output of 120 J for 
every 480 J of work input.what would be its efficiency ?<br>
<em class ="center ">Solution ;</em><br>
Using <strong >η = work output / work input</strong ><br>
          η = 120 J / 480 J <br> 
          η = 0.25 (or 25%)<br>
<em><strong >Note</strong ></em> with this machine to find the work output if 
2800 J of work goes into the machine we need to 
rearrange the equation:<br>
η = work output / work input<br>
work output = η × work input<br>
work output = 0.25 × 2800 J <br>
work output = 700 J <br>
